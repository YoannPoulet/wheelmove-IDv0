  "intro_text": "<p>Welcome to this application for analyzing locomotor actions in Manual Wheelchairs (MWC). This application allows you to:</p><ul><li>Determine the linear and angular speeds of the MWC from inertial measurement unit data.</li><li>Automatically identify locomotor tasks by customizing the thresholds used.</li><li>Visualize the results in clear, simplified chronograms.</li><li>Export the results in CSV format for further processing.</li></ul><p>For ethical privacy reasons and thanks to the technical solution used (JavaScript), all calculations are performed locally.<br/>As a result, the data entered in this application is never transferred to a server or stored.</p><p>Before getting started, it is important to:</p><ul><li>Carefully read the file loading instructions (Help button at the top right).</li><li>Ensure that the recorded data is complete, as incomplete data is not handled by this application.</li><li>Understand how the processing works and the meaning of the chronograms by reading the help section or the publication associated with this work (at the bottom of the page).</li></ul><p>Once you have reviewed all this information, use the buttons below to navigate through the application.</p>",
